//Project Overview at a Glance//

--> Our project operates within the medical realm, focusing on the intricate domain of the Gastrointestinal Tract.

--> Utilizing three distinct datasets, each encompassing varying class types, our project delves into diversity. These datasets comprise 4, 8, and 23 classes, respectively.

--> Our central objective revolves around the meticulous analysis of dataset performances across three diverse models.

--> Across the project's trajectory, a total of nine base models underwent training. This entailed comprehensive exploration of all three datasets using ResNet, Vgg16, and Densenet models.

--> In addition to the base models, two transfer learning models were also employed to enrich our approach.

--> Hyperparameter fine-tuning was meticulously executed. We employed learning rate adjustment for ResNet and optimized batch sizes for Densenet. This strategic tuning transpired within the context of the 8-class dataset.

--> A pivotal step included a comparative assessment of accuracy outcomes from all the models, culminating in a comprehensive insights-driven analysis.
