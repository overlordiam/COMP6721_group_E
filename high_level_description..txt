//High Level Description of the project.//

--> Our Domain of the project is in the Medidcal field, that is the Gastrointestinal Tract.
--> We have used three Datasets containing three different types of classes. One dataset consists of 4 classes, other with 8 classes and the last one with 23 classes.
--> Our Aim is to pass these datasets into 3 different models and to have a detailed illustrations regarding the accuracies of different models.
--> we have trained in total of 9 base models, all three datasets with all three models. Our models are ResNet, Vgg16 and Densenet.
--> we have also trained two models on transfer learning.
--> we used learning rate on ResNet and batch size on Densenet. This Hyperparameter tuning was done on the 8 class dataset.
--> Further we compared all the accuracies of the given models.
