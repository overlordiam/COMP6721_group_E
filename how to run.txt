//Instruction on how to train your model.//

1) for the model to train the prerequistes are datasets and any notebook such as google colab or kaggle.
2) we have used both for colab and kaggle both for training of the model.
3) Considering the google colab notebook first we mount the drive on to our notebook.
4) we have mounted the drive beacuse the datasets are located in our drive and to use the particular dataset we have to initialise our google drive.
5) The next important step to import all the modules that are going to be used.
6) for the upcoming step we have to load the data and split the images we make use of the image preprocess functions and in this function we create data loaders which includes train_loader,
   val_loader, and test_loader.
7) After this data loader is ploote for visualization.
8) Once this is done we move on to Train function.
9) Accordingly the models are then used for example we have used ResNet, VGG16, and Densenet. So if we decide to train resNet that particular model is been pased. this function includes 
   model definition nand initialization
10)After accomplishmentof traininig we save the weights, train and validation values.
11)The last step is to calculate the accuracy on a trained model.
